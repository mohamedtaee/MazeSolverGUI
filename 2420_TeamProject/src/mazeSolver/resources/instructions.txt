The MazeSolver GUI allows the user to create a Maze using grids.

The options you will have include setting a "Start", "End", and "Obstacle".

Once you have done that, you can either reset the squares, solve the maze, or reset the entire maze.

Don’t forget to check the “Extras” tab for additional information and settings.
